    <p class="header2">How the Percentages are Calculated </p>
    <p class="header2">DBE Compliance %:</p><p>An average of 3 metrics:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the DBE Plan Compliant</li>
        <li>Has the DBE started work (measured by if paid any amount yet) </li>
        <li>Has the DBE had a CUF inspection and if it revealed any issues  </li>
      </ul>
      <p><p class="header2">PW Compliance %: </p>How many CPR entries had underpayments vs the total number of CPR entries (1 CPR entry = Employee, day worked, ST/OT)  </p>
      <p><p class="header2">Payment Application %: </p>Percentage of Payment Application rows that had no variances with recalculated amounts  </p>
      <p class="header2">Contractor Compliance Analysis and Metrics Table:  </p>
      <p class="header2">   For each contractor, lists the following factors: </p> 
      <ul><li>DBE Plan: a percentage of their planned DBE spend submitted for the job compared to their total contract value. 10% is compliant for this dashboard. A green check mark is visible if the plan => 10%, while a red X appears if the plan is < 10%  </li>
        <li>DBE – CUF Inspection: Lists if the DBE has gone through a CUF Inspection, and if it had any flags or not. At least one flag during the inspection will trigger the red x showing “non-compliant”. A green check appears if the inspection was performed and had no issues, while a yellow icon will appear if an inspection has yet to be provided.  </li>
        <li>DBE % of Contract Spent: Shows how much of each contractors planned DBE Spend they have paid the DBE to date.  </li>
        <li>PW Underpayments: $ value of Prevailing Wage underpayments have been derived from the Certified Payrolls (Uses Certified Payrolls and Applicable Prevailing Wage Rates)  </li>
        <li>Sum of Variance: Miscalculations identified when reviewing payment applications  </li>
        <li>PA Billed to Date: Payment Applications submitted to date by each contractor. </li></ul>
